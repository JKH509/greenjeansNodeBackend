# greenjeansNodeBackend
I am creating a Client facing website, along with a full blown program on the backend. My inspiration for this came to me while I was still a business owner but didn't have the knowledge to do
this work. Eventually this will have route scheduling, invoicing, assigning routes, profit and loss, bids, along with programming that allows the admin to create bids simply by
entering the information in the UI.
